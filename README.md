**No Fungible Token**

Upon deployment, the token sets its owner - the Call.caller (deployer). The owner has special privilege - the ability to create (mint) new tokens. 
When token is created it is associate with a user - the tokenOwner. 
The token owner can act upon this token in various ways. 
They can set it's metadata, transfer it, allow it to be transfered on his/her behalf or completely destroy it.

In addition, the smart contract keeps track of  data - who owns a given token,
